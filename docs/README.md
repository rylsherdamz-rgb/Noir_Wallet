# Noir Documentation

Everything a developer needs to reproduce, verify and extend Noir: NFC device registration, constrained delegated payment authorization and an x402 tap-to-pay flow on Stellar Testnet, built on three Soroban contracts and a React Native Android app. Released under the [MIT License](../LICENSE).

## Still to do

Left for later on purpose. The docs above already describe these as not done yet.

- [ ] **Tap → `payment_escrow.authorize` in the app.** Today a tap pays from the agent wallet (`x402.payWithAgent`). Wire the tap screens to `authorize` (agent-signed, nonce per device + agent). The SDK's `authorizePayment` is the reference implementation.
- [ ] **Merchant `claim` in the app.** Show `pending_balance` and a claim action for the receiving wallet.
- [ ] **Escrow deposit entry point.** Link a button to `/agent-fund/<id>?mode=escrow` (the screen and `x402.fundEscrow` already exist).
- [ ] **Redeploy contracts** so the Week 4 security fixes are live ([contracts.md](contracts.md#week-4-security-fixes)); the live deploy has a cross-asset drain and an agent-hijack bug. Then propagate the new IDs ([deployment.md](deployment.md#propagate-new-ids-through-the-docs)) and re-run `npm run test:testnet`.
- [ ] **Live Testnet run of `authorize` + `claim` and every reject case.** The runner is written: `cd sdk/agent-sdk && npm run test:security-matrix` ([testing.md](testing.md#live-security-matrix)). Run it against the new deploy and commit its evidence file.
- [ ] **Physical NTAG213 on a real Android phone**: provisioning, write timeout, ownership screens.
- [ ] **Final demo video**: steps 1–8 of the walkthrough on a real phone.
