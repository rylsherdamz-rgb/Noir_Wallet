/**
 * User-facing messages for Soroban contract errors.
 *
 * Contract errors reach the app as text like `HostError: Error(Contract, #3)`.
 * The numeric code is only meaningful per contract (agent_registry #4 is
 * InvalidPolicy, device_registry #4 is AlreadyRegistered), so the caller must
 * say which contract it was talking to. Codes mirror the `#[contracterror]`
 * enums in backend/contracts/<name>/src/lib.rs — keep them in sync.
