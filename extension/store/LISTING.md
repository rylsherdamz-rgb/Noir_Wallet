# Chrome Web Store listing — Noir

Copy these into the Developer Dashboard (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole).
Upload `noir-wallet-extension-<version>.zip` from `npm run release` (or the `noir-extension` artifact of the
Extension CI workflow). Never upload an older zip lying around in `extension/`: only a fresh build has the
current contract IDs. Releases after the first one: see [Releasing](#releasing).

## Store listing

**Name:** Noir

**Summary** (≤132 chars):
> Stellar wallet for dApps. Connect sites, approve every signature in plain words, and see your Noir tap-to-pay cards.

**Category:** Tools (or Productivity) · **Language:** English

**Description:**
```
Noir brings your Stellar wallet to the browser.

• Same wallet as the Noir app — import your 12-word recovery phrase (SEP-5) and get the same address, or create a new wallet.
• Connect to Stellar dApps — sites ask once; you can disconnect any of them from the wallet.
• Approve every signature in plain words — payments, contract calls and their arguments, Soroban authorizations and messages, with warnings when something looks risky.
• Network-safe — requests for a different network are refused, and authorizations are checked against your network before signing.
• Your Noir cards — link NFC cards, fund and withdraw their escrow, set each card's per-tap limit, and unlink a card with its escrow returned.
• Tap to pay — charge a Noir card or pay a merchant from one, scan payment QR codes, and keep receipts.
• Works with the Stellar Wallets Kit and any app that supports SEP-43 wallets (window.noir.stellar).

Security: your recovery phrase is encrypted with your password (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2 600k) and never leaves your device. The wallet locks itself after 15 minutes. No account, no analytics, no tracking.

Noir runs on Stellar Testnet today; Mainnet signing is available for any dApp.

## Privacy practices tab

**Single purpose:**
> A Stellar cryptocurrency wallet: it holds the user's Stellar key and lets websites request the user's address and signatures, each approved by the user.

**Permission justifications:**
| Permission | Justification |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Stores the password-encrypted recovery phrase, public address, network choice and the list of sites the user connected. The unlocked key is kept in session storage only. |
| `alarms` | Locks the wallet automatically after 15 minutes without use, and checks once a minute for incoming payments. |
| `activeTab` | When the user presses "Scan the QR on this tab", captures the visible tab once to read a Stellar payment QR code. Only the tab the user opened Noir on, only on that click. |
| `notifications` (optional, requested from Settings) | Shows a notification when a payment arrives, only after the user turns notifications on. |
| Host permissions (`horizon.stellar.org`, `horizon-testnet.stellar.org`, `soroban-testnet.stellar.org`, `friendbot.stellar.org`) | Reads the user's balance and Noir card data from public Stellar network services, and funds Testnet accounts via Friendbot when the user asks. |
| Content scripts on `https://*/*` (and localhost) | Injects the `window.noir.stellar` wallet interface so any Stellar website can request a connection or a signature. The script holds no data and only relays requests to the wallet, which asks the user to approve each one. |

**Remote code:** No, I am not using remote code. (All JavaScript is bundled in the package.)

**Data usage:** The extension does not collect or transmit user data to the developer. Check none of the data-type boxes, then certify:
- I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases
- I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose
- I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes

(live once PR #14 is merged and GitHub Pages redeploys)

## Distribution

Visibility: Public (or Unlisted while you test with real users). Regions: all.
Review usually takes a few days; content scripts on all https sites can trigger a longer, in-depth review.

## Releasing

The first submission is manual (listing text, graphics and the privacy tab above). After that:

1. Bump `version` in **both** `extension/manifest.json` and `extension/package.json` (the store refuses a version it has seen).
2. `cd extension && npm run release` (typecheck, unit tests, Playwright e2e, then `noir-wallet-extension-<version>.zip`).
3. Publish, either way:
   - **CI:** Actions → *Extension CI* → *Run workflow* → `publish: submit-for-review` (or `upload-only` for a draft).
     Needs the `chrome-web-store` environment with secrets `CWS_CLIENT_ID`, `CWS_CLIENT_SECRET`,
     `CWS_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID`, `CWS_EXTENSION_ID`.
   - **Local:** export the same five variables, then `npm run publish:cws -- --dry-run`, then `npm run publish:cws`.

Credentials: in Google Cloud, enable the *Chrome Web Store API* and create an OAuth client; get a refresh token for
scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore` from the OAuth 2.0 Playground ("Use your own OAuth credentials"),
signed in as the account that owns the item. The publisher ID is under Developer Dashboard → Publisher → Settings.
